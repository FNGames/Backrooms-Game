# Backrooms
1. What are the Backrooms?

The Backrooms are a fictional liminal dimension—a place you end up when you “noclip” out of reality by accident. Think of reality like a video game map: if you clip through the floor, instead of falling into nothing, you fall into the Backrooms.

They are:

Endless

Artificial

Mostly empty

Slightly “wrong” in ways your brain hates

The most famous entry point is slipping out of reality in places that already feel empty or forgotten—offices, hallways, storage rooms, malls, schools after hours.

2. Origin (real-world)

The Backrooms started in 2019 from a 4chan post. Someone posted a creepy photo of yellow office hallways and wrote something like:

“If you’re not careful and you noclip out of reality, you’ll end up in the Backrooms…”

That single post exploded. The internet collectively went:

“Oh. Oh no. That’s terrifying.”

From there, people expanded it into:

Lore

Levels

Creatures

Rules

Survival guides

It became collaborative horror, similar to SCP—but more abstract and psychological.

3. The Core Fear: Liminal Horror

The Backrooms aren’t scary because of monsters first.
They’re scary because of liminality.

Liminal spaces are places that exist between purposes:

Empty schools

Closed malls

Office buildings at night

Hallways that go nowhere

Your brain expects:

People

Purpose

An exit

The Backrooms remove all three.

4. Level 0 – “The Lobby”

This is the most iconic level.

Appearance

Endless yellow office rooms

Stained carpet

Fluorescent lights that hum constantly

No windows

No doors that lead anywhere useful

Key details

Smells like damp carpet

Lighting flickers inconsistently

Rooms subtly change when you’re not looking

No clocks

No sense of time

Psychological effect

Isolation

Paranoia

Sensory overload from the buzzing lights

The feeling that you’re being watched—even if nothing is there

This level alone can break people mentally.

5. Time, Space, and Physics

The Backrooms do not follow normal rules.

Time

Time may slow down, loop, or stop

You don’t age normally

You can sleep but never feel rested

Space

Rooms rearrange themselves

Hallways loop

You can walk for days and end up somewhere familiar

Maps don’t work long-term

Physics

Gravity mostly works

Electricity exists but is unreliable

Food and water are rare and questionable

Sound travels strangely (you hear things that aren’t there)

6. Levels (The Bigger Backrooms)

Over time, people created hundreds of levels. Some famous types:

Safe-ish Levels

Empty hotels

Warehouses

Parking garages

Pool rooms (Level 37 / Poolrooms)

These are creepy but relatively stable.

Hostile Levels

Pitch-black areas

Flooded zones

Places with constant alarms or sirens

Levels that actively change to trap you

Illogical Levels

Infinite staircases

Rooms that defy geometry

Hallways that shrink or stretch

Spaces that respond to your emotions

Not all levels are meant to be survived.

7. Entities (NOT the main horror, but still important)

Entities exist, but the best versions of Backrooms lore don’t rely on them constantly.

Common traits:

They don’t follow human logic

They mimic sounds or shapes incorrectly

They often appear only when you’re vulnerable

Examples (no gore):

Humanoid figures that move wrong

Smiling shapes that freeze when watched

Noisy things you never actually see

Entities that pretend to be human

The scariest thing?
Sometimes nothing happens at all.

8. Survival “Rules”

Unofficial but widely accepted:

Don’t trust voices

Don’t stay in one place too long

Don’t panic (panic attracts attention in some lore)

Conserve energy

Mark walls—but don’t rely on marks staying

Some levels reward calm behavior.
Others punish curiosity.

9. Why the Backrooms are actually terrifying

Not because of monsters.

But because:

You’re completely forgotten

No one knows you’re gone

There’s no guarantee of death or escape

You might survive forever… alone

It’s existential horror, not slasher horror.

10. Different “Canons”

There is no single official Backrooms lore.

You’ll see:

Minimalist canon (Level 0 only)

Wiki-based expanded canon

Analog horror versions (Kane Pixels)

Game interpretations

All are valid. The Backrooms thrive on ambiguity.

11. The Kane Pixels Interpretation (important)

This version frames the Backrooms as:

A man-made experiment

A space humans accidentally opened

Something that wasn’t meant to be accessed

This adds:

Found footage

Research facilities

Reality tearing itself apart

Still no clear answers—which makes it worse.

12. The Real Horror

The Backrooms tap into:

Fear of being forgotten

Fear of endless routine

Fear that reality is fragile

Fear that escape isn’t guaranteed

It’s the horror of existing without meaning or witnesses.
